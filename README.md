# RedBat

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RedFoxCode/redbat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RedFoxCode/redbat)

**redbat** is a re-implementation of EventEmitter Node.JS with extra-features (middlewares, ttl and other).

# Features

* Fluent API
* MidÐ²lewares
* TTL for listeners
* Namespaces
* Namespace event piping

# Reference

### Namespaces

Namespaces store events/middlewares where events are emitted/processed/manipulated. Namespaces are like separate rooms in the flat - if you will say `hello` in one room, it will not be said in another room.

When creating EventEmitter instance and executing this code...

```javascript
const emitter = new redbat.EventEmitter();

emitter
    .on("test", function() {})
    .emit("test");
```

...it will emit and process event `test` in namespace called `default`. If you wish you can change it's name to whatever you like by providing options argument to EventEmitter constructor as first argument:

```javascript
const emitter = new redbat.EventEmitter({
    defaultNamespace: "df"
});
```

Now if we will call `on` method it will be emitted in `df` namespace. To emit event to another namespace you need to use `namespace` method:

```javascript
emitter.namespace(); // will return default namespace
emitter.namespace("my namespace"); // will create and return new namespace called 'my namespace'
emitter.namespace("my namespace"); // will return already existing namespace
```

To emit event in namespace you do pretty much the same:

```javascript
emitter
    .namespace("my namespace")
    .on("test", function() {}) // will be executed
    .emit("test");

emitter.emit("test"); // will not be executed (emitted in default namespace)
```

# Listeners

**on**

To create new listener you should call `on` method of Namespace. It accepts next arguments:

1. **type** (required), array or string
2. **ttl** (optional), number
3. **handler** (required), function

Type is event name on which listeners should be called. It can be string: `"my event"`, it will be triggered by event `my event`. And it can be array of strings: `["my event", "my event 2"]`, it will be triggered by event `my event` and `my event 2`.

TTL is abbreviation from `time to live`. It's a number representing time in milliseconds after which listener will be destroyed.

Handler is function that will be called when event will be fired.

To destroy listener use `delete` method.

```javascript
emitter.delete("1337");
```

**emit**

To emit event you should call `emit` method of Namespace. It accepts type as first argument. Other arguments will be given in event handler.

```javascript
emitter
    .on("test", function(a, b, c) {
        console.log(a, b, c); // logs '1 2 3'
    })
    .emit("test", 1, 2, 3);
```

**chaining events**

If you have more then one listener for one event you shoud call function provided as last argument given in event handler. By calling it you assume that event handler has finished it's work.

```javascript
emitter
    .on("test", function(next) {
        next();
    })
    .on("test", function(next) {
        next();
    })
    .emit("test");
```

**once and wait**

If you need to process handler only once and then destroy listener use `once` method. It accepts same arguments as `on` and you can chain them.

Wait is the same as `once`, the only difference is that `wait` method returns instance of Promise.

```javascript
emitter.wait("test").then(console.log);
```

So you can use it with await (ES6)

```javascript
async function waitPlease() {
    return console.log(await emitter.wait("test"));
}

waitPlease();
```

**event piping**

You can pipe (redirect) events from one namespace to another by calling `pipe` method of Namespace. It accepts Namespace as first argument or it's name.

```javascript
emitter.namespace("1").pipe("2");

emitter.namespace("1")
    .on("test", console.log); // will be called

emitter.namespace("2")
    .on("test", console.log); // also will be called

emitter.namespace("1").emit("test", "Hello");

// but...

emitter.namespace("2").emit("test", "Hello"); // handler in namespace '1' will not be called
```

> **Note:** DO NOT try the following code. It will fall in recursion

```javascript
emitter.namespace("1").pipe("2");
emitter.namespace("2").pipe("1");
```

To unpipe namespace use `unpipe` method

```javscript
emitter
    .namespace("1")
    .unpipe("2");
```

**middlewares**

Middlewares are functions that are called before processing any event of namespace (doesn't matter does event handler exist or not). You can have as many middlewares as you want (until memory runs out). Middleware handler takes three arguments:

1. **type** string - you got it lol
2. **args** array - array of arguments given in emit
3. **next** function - must be called when middleware finished it's work

To add a middleware use `use` method of Namespace

```javascript
emitter.use(function(type, args, next) {
    console.log("I'm a middleware");
    next();
});
```

Example of three middlewares:

```javascript
emitter
    .use(function(type, args, next) {
        console.log(1);
        next();
    })
    .use(function(type, args, next) {
        console.log(2);
        next();
    })
    .emit("some event");
```

You may not call `next` if middleware handler takes only 2 arguments. `next` will be called by it self

```javascript
// will also work
emitter
    .use(function(type, args) {
        console.log(1);
    })
    .use(function(type, args) {
        console.log(2);
    })
    .emit("some event");
```

**onFast, onceFast, emitFast**

If you don't need features like TTL or middlewares, but performance use `onFast`, `onceFast` and `emitFast` to create and call listeners. `onFast` takes same arguments, but without TTL. `onceFast` takes same arguments as `onFast`. `emitFast` takes same arguments as `emit`. Using this method this will disable features like middlewares.

> **Note:** I don't actually know why you will need this, because you can use regular EventEmitter
